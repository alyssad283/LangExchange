# Project overview
LangExchange is a messaging system that has real time translation options expressed in an android mobile application. This service allows for three main tools for the user to use. They can chat with other users, create quizzes based off of words that are unknown to them, and have access to a real time translator. Through their chats they will have the option to send images and audio files while having the option to translate them. When audio files are translated they will create a transcript that can be viewed from the original language and the preferred translated language. This application will create incentives for the users to continue to use the app and learn their language by giving them trophies based off of the words they have retained from their flashcards and quizzes. Global connectedness is growing year by year, and along with it grows the need to communicate across language barriers. LangExchange will provide the essential function of helping people learn to translate for themselves, or by doing the translating for them.

The app is divided into four tabs: profile, chatting, studying, and translating. In the profile tab, the user can choose and/or change languages they are learning and display the achievements they have earned by using the app consistently. In the chatting tab, users can find other users who speak their target languages natively, or who are also learning the language. Through the chat, users can select single words to translate and make into a flashcard or translate full sentences. Audio messages and images can also be sent and translated. In the study tab, users can go over their collection of flashcards, and create quizzes to test their knowledge. Finally, the translation tab allows users to take a picture of text, record speech, or type a message that they wish to translate.
